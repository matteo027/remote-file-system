‚ö†Ô∏è Notes

    All routes under /api/files/*, /api/directories/*, and /api/mod/* require the user to be authenticated via middleware (isLoggedIn).

    The route PUT /api/files/* appears to serve both writing and renaming, which may lead to conflict unless method differentiation is handled (e.g., via headers or request body).
